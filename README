The purpose of libfixposix is to offer replacements for parts of POSIX
whose behaviour is inconsistent across *NIX flavours.

* Compilation

If you've downloaded this library through git, you'll first need to
generate the ./configure script; in order to do that you need to have
at least autoconf-2.65 and automake-1.11 and to run this inside the
top directory:
> autoreconf -i

For best results use a dedicated build directory instead of running
the configure script directly in the source tree:
> mkdir build
> ../libfixposix/configure

On Linux, you might need to run «ldconfig» as superuser after
installing, otherwise the *nix linker won't be able to find the library
